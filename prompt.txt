App Overview

Build a mobile-first native web application using React Native with Expo that visually simulates people entering and exiting a candy store in the middle of New York City.

The app represents “The Candy Store of New York”, featuring:

A centered layout

A light grey background

A NYC city block with skyscrapers, small storefronts, and a brightly colored candy store in the center

Animated characters that enter the candy store with no candy and exit holding lots of candy when buttons are clicked

The app must be compatible with mobile and web and deployable to Vercel using Expo Web.

Requirements
Tech Stack

Expo (latest version)

React Native

Expo Web compatibility

React Native Animated or Reanimated

Functional components + hooks

No backend required

Layout

Light grey background

Centered vertical layout

Large, easy-to-read title button centered near the top that reads:
“THE CANDY STORE OF NEW YORK”

NYC street scene below the title:

Tall NYC skyscrapers in the background

Small stores (bodega, pizza shop, newsstand, etc.)

A large candy store in the center

Candy store has:

Bright colors

Big display windows

A visible door for entering and exiting

Five character buttons underneath the scene

Features
Character System

There are 5 unique character types:

Black woman with afro hair

White woman with blonde hair

Man with afro and big beard

Little light-skin girl with curly hair

Old man with a very long beard and a cane

Each character has two visual states:

Entering the store → no candy

Exiting the store → holding bags, boxes, or piles of candy

Animation Flow

When a button is clicked:

The selected character appears off-screen on the left

The character walks toward the candy store door

The character disappears briefly (inside the store)

The character reappears exiting the store holding lots of candy

The character walks off toward the right side of the screen

Animations should be smooth and playful, with slight bouncing to show excitement.

Button Behavior

Each character has its own button

Every button click:

Spawns a new instance of that character

Runs the full enter-store → exit-with-candy animation

Clicking the same button multiple times:

Adds more characters

Characters do not replace each other

Multiple characters can be animated at once

State Management

Track click count per character type

Use unique IDs for each animated character

Track animation phase (entering, inside, exiting)

Remove character from state after leaving the screen

API (if needed)

No external APIs required

All animation logic handled locally

Candy visuals can be:

SVGs

Emojis

PNG placeholders

Styling

Use StyleSheet.create

Light grey background (#f2f2f2)

Bright, colorful candy store design

High-contrast buttons

Friendly, playful NYC vibe

Mobile-first, responsive layout

Characters clearly change appearance when exiting with candy

Deployment Readiness

Fully compatible with Expo Web

No platform-specific APIs that break on web

Ready for deployment to Vercel

Include comments or notes explaining:

Running the app locally

Building for web

Deploying with Vercel
