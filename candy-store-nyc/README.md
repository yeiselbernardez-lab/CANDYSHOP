## The Candy Store of New York

An Expo (React Native + Web) animation demo:

- Light grey background, centered layout
- NYC city block with a bright candy store in the middle
- 5 character buttons; each click spawns a new character instance
- Animation flow: **enter → briefly inside → exit with lots of candy → walk offscreen**
- Multiple characters can animate at the same time
